    <p class="text">The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite<br>
      sex is something that runs deep with everyone, even<br>
      though most people don't take the time to find someone<br>
       who truly respects them. It seems like people are just<br>looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of<br>
         attention, settling for something much less than respect. I<br>
          am convinced one of the best ways to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.
   <br><br>
     I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is Respect?
     Respect is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly
     they are valued.
